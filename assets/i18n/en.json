For this purpose, the projects were more consequent, and as such required bigger groups with a good <strong>organisation</strong>.<br/>My <strong>third year</strong> allowed me to <strong>diversify</strong> in my competencies. Especially on developing mobile applications, cybersecurity and DevOps. ",
